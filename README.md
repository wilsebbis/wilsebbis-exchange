A way to trade stocks as tokens on the blockchain, allowing users to utilize smart contracts and starting the transition period from boards of directors to DAOs.

Just a concept currently.

We hold your assets, then allow you to trade those assets on a decentralized network.

The value of those tokens should never dip below the traded value while the market is open, as the tokens can be turned in to get the original stock back. However, during times when the traditional markets are closed, the token market can continue to fluctuate as people speculate on what the value of the stock will be at the time of the traditional market reopening.

The big picture idea is that people will eventually be able to trade any stock or currency from any exchange, at any time, from any place in the world. You will have a 24/7/365 global decentralized trading network where people can buy whatever asset they want (no preventing you from buying $GME like Robinhood did), and anyone can daytrade to their heart's content.

In the future, we can even move beyond stocks, offering plots of land and buildings on the decentralized free market as well. Eventually we no longer want to hold the legal assets separately, but want them to be integrated directly into the blockchain, so there will be one global stock exchange operating 24/7/365, and there will be no difference between a company having an IPO or an ICO, or between a board of directors and a DAO. The Googles and Facebooks of the future will launch on the WILSEBBIS exchange, not the NYSE or NASDAQ.
