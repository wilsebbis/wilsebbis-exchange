A digital-goods-only crowdfunding platform utilizing stablecoins, DAOs, smart contracts, and NFTs.

Just a concept currently.

Specifics:

This project is aimed at making the blockchain mainstream and approachable for people who aren't enthusiasts.

A user submits a pitch to the site, which then creates a smart contract behind the scenes. This smart contract runs off of a stablecoin, which is traded for equity in the product the user pitched. Once the pitch is successfully funded, each stablecoin translates into one governance token in the DAO, so the minimum investment is $1.

As an example: A person wants to make a new app, let's say it's a Candy Crush-type game or something. They ask for $100 (just for example purposes, obviously), in exchange for 10% equity in their app's DAO. They don't have to know about any of this blockchain stuff, they just use a nice web and mobile interface. But they offer a certain dividend on each governance token. So now someone bought 10% equity for $100, and the creator of the app still owns 90% equity, now valued at $900. The creator then uploads their product into our perpetual storage, and each purchase of that software is now split between equity-holders according to the initial contract. So now if they make $10 off their app, and they assigned a full split between equity holders, they will now get $9, and the person who bought 10% equity for $100 will now receive $1. Then the equity-holders (including the creator) get to vote in the DAO like how board members would in a board meeting.

Now that the crowdfunding is over, others can now buy governance tokens, but they are no longer anchored at $1 in stablecoin. Let's say that the app has made $10,000 and offers full dividends for shareholders. That means that owning 10% equity gives you $1,000. It no longer makes sense for 10% equity to cost $100, or in other words for there to be 1,000 governance tokens with each governance token being worth $1. The size of the governance token pool won't grow (unless the DAO votes to grow it), so each of the 1,000 governance tokens will now be worth at least $10 if the app is not suspected to go down in popularity, because the app has made $10,000 in the last quarter and is expected to make the same amount in the next quarter, and will probably be worth more than that if the app is thought to grow in the next quarter.

Those with control of the DAO can also get rid of the original creator and take control of the project themselves in order to protect their investments, or make the dividends larger, or issue more governance tokens, etc.

So you have a few elements:
1. Crowdfunding: Person pitches on a smart contract, gets stablecoin investment
2. Governance: Stablecoins converted into DAO governance tokens used to make decisions about the product
3. Storefront: Product is sold as NFT that provides DRM access to product held in perpetual storage
4. Trading: Governance tokens are sold on another marketplace
5. Stablecoin ecosystem itself: Tokenomics based heavily on Terra/Luna, with $WIL stablecoin (1 dollar Wil), and $SEB as an inflation-management coin similar to LUNA
6. Site governance itself: $BIS governance token for making changes to the site such as increasing or decreasing the standard 2.5% fee

Business-wise:
1. 2.5% fee for each crowdfunding payment (at investor level, so everyone who wants to buy $1 worth of shares must pay $1.025 worth of stablecoin)
2. 2.5% fee for each NFT purchase on storefront
3. 2.5% fee for each DAO governance token traded

Users can choose to pay gas fees and perpetual storage fees to get lower site fees, or to skip those and pay a higher fee to the site itself (maybe 5% or similar). Users need not sign up with a wallet at first, or know anything about the blockchain, as regular USD can be automatically converted into stablecoins by the centralized part of the site. The idea is that there will be a centralized "average Joe" version without fees, wallets, etc., as well as a "crypto enthusiast" version for people who know about that kind of stuff.

Big picture:
1. Lower fees than other crowdfunding services
2. More ownership over your belongings
3. More privacy
4. Less censorship
5. Can invest smaller sums ($1 minimum) as opposed to things like EquityZen which may require a $10,000 minimum

Anyone can now be an entrepreneur without having to jump through legal hoops and incorporate and fly to a big city to give multiple in-person pitches, like Kickstarter or Indiegogo for selling equity on the blockchain.

Anyone can now be an investor in startups right from their phone, like Robinhood or Public.com for buying equity on the blockchain.

We also see a market for integrating a mixture of Change.org and GoFundMe. This will mainly be an alternative to GoFundMe, but the integration with a service similar to Change.org will be its "gimmick," making it a place where people can promote causes they're passionate about and their votes will be held securely on the blockchain. It will be more focused on donating to causes for systemic change rather than personal medical bills and such.

We also think that there is a market for flexible campaigns where the creator can set a minimum and maximum equity arrangement. So let's say they're looking for $100 for 10%, but would accept down to $50 for 5%, or up to $200 for 20%. Otherwise if the funding isn't flexible, people will only be able to fund up to the maximum, which means if a project is fully funded, nobody will be able to buy any more equity. For example: if you try to buy the last $10 worth of equity that was available when you last looked, but someone else has bought $5 in the interim, your purchase will still go through, but you will only be charged for $5 worth, and the rest will be refunded.
